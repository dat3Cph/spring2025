# DateTime API Exercises

Given the `Employee` class from the previous exercise with Java Streams.

Add a `birthdate` to the `Employee` class and implement the following tasks using the Java Time API:

1. Calculate the age of each employee based on their birthdate

2. Calculate the average age of all employees

3. Filter and display employees who have birthdays in a specific month.

4. Group employees by birth month and display the count of employees in each group.

5. List all employees who has a birthday in the current month.

Check these hints for [explanations of the date and time API in Java 8](../../toolbox/java/deepdive/datetime.md).
