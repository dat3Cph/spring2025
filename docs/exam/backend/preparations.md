# Backend Exam Preparation

## Monday - SP-2 review

**09:00 - 10:30 - Review of SP-2 - Online**

Join demo session on Zoom.

At the review:

- Present your vision of the project
- Give a brief status of how far you have come
- Show your database ERD
- Make a small demo of your endpoints through your http files
- Run the tests (if you have managed to write some)
- Reflect on the process so far - and what you have learned
- Make a list of the things you think you need to learn and train before the exam

## Tuesday - mock exam I

**09:00 - 14:00 - Mock exam I - Home assignment**

Try out a exam set. Give yourself 5 hours to solve it. You might not make it in 5 hours - but that is the point. You get faster by training. Solve the rest of the exercise afterwards.

You can make the mock exam at home - or at the school. Make an effort to solve it alone. You can discuss the solutions with your team afterwards.

The mock exams [will be posted here](./mockexams.md). Choose the first one from fall 2024. It is the one that is most similar to the exam you will have.

## Wednesday

**Review of mock exam I - in Lyngby**

- 09:00 - 10:00 Demo of SP-2. The last teams will show their project and get feedback.

- 10:00 - 12.30 Review of mock exam I: We will review the mock exam I. We will go through the solutions and discuss the problems. We will also discuss the things you need to learn and train before the exam. Hopefully, one of you will volunteer to present the solution to the rest of the class. Then we can make a "fake" exam situation.

## Thursday and Friday

**Self-study days**

Thursday and Friday are self-study days. It is a good idea to use these days to train the things you have identified as weaknesses in your knowledge. It's also recommended to go through the mock exams again and see if you can solve them faster this time. It's the best way to prepare. Also, spend some time to craft a good "start code template".
